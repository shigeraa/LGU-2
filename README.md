all the modules and submodules will be inside the content folder, just find your module there and start making your own submodules,

if you want to add some changes to the index/main design or texts you want to change just clone this repo if you want to add it to your pc and push it so i can check the changes later 
and push the files to the repository.

if you dont know how to use github. theres a tutorial on youtube on how to add git on vscode so that its much easier to use
